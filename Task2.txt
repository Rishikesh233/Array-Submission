
To effectively respond to site changes that might impact your operations, consider implementing a few technical strategies. Utilize libraries and tools like Puppeteer or BeautifulSoup, which provide robust web scraping capabilities, making it easier to adapt to changes in website structure. Employ version control systems like Git to manage your codebase and track changes over time. Regularly monitor websites with automated scripts that use headless browsers, such as Chromium, to ensure your operations remain effective in the face of JavaScript rendering changes. When selectors change, use cascading stylesheet (CSS) attribute selectors or dynamic XPath expressions for more resilient data extraction. Be prepared for handling errors using try-catch blocks and implement user-agent rotation, proxy servers, and IP rotation for stealthy scraping. Stay compliant with legal considerations like a website's terms of service and consider implementing rate limiting, caching, and throttling mechanisms for efficient and ethical scraping.
